Weather API Query

Run the app.py file and then click the localhost link in the console to launch. You must provide your own API key from openweathermap.org by replacing the text in the .env file so that it reads:

API_Key=1234123412341234

With your key replacing the numbers.

Screenshots of the websites output are included in the screenshots folder, to demonstrate intended output.
